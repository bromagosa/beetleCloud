		<h1>Turtlestitch - Coded Embroidery</h1>

		<p>Turtlestitch is based on a browser-based educational programming language (Snap!) to
		generate patterns for embroidery machines. It is easy to use, requiring no
		prior knowledge in programming, yet powerful in creating nowels patterns
		for embroidery. It is usefull for designers to experiment with
		generative aesthetics and precision embroidery as well as tool for
		innovative workshops combining an introduction to programing with haptic
		output. </p>

		<p>Turtlestitch uses Snap!s "pen module" which it interprets as a needle
		and transforms its output into widely-used embroidery file formats.</p>

		<h2>About Snap!</h2> 

		<p>Snap!  is a visual, drag-and-drop programming language that allows
		students to create interactive stories, animations, games, and more,
		while learning about mathematical and computational ideas. Snap! was
		inspired by Scratch, but also targets both novice and more advanced
		students by including and expanding Scratch's features.</p>

		<p>Snap! is developed by the University of California, Berkeley with the
		support from the National Science Foundation, MioSoft, and the
		CommunicationDesign Group at SAP Labs.<br />
		The design of Snap! is influenced and inspired by Scratch, from Lifelong
		Kindergarten group at the MIT Media Lab. For more information see<br />
